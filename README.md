This project, titled *Guess the Number Game*, is a simple Java-based guessing game that engages users in guessing a randomly generated number. The core functionality revolves around generating a random number between 1 and 100, which the user must identify through a series of guesses. The project utilizes the `Random` class to create the target number and the `Scanner` class to capture user input from the console. The game begins by welcoming the user and providing instructions on the task. Each time the user inputs a guess, the program compares it to the random number. If the guess is too low, the program provides feedback, instructing the user that the guess was "Too low" and to "Try again." Similarly, if the guess is too high, it notifies the user that it was "Too high," prompting further attempts. This continues until the user correctly guesses the number, ending the loop. The program keeps a count of the number of guesses taken, which it displays once the correct guess is made. Upon a correct guess, the user is congratulated and informed of the number of attempts they made. The game then terminates gracefully, closing the `Scanner` resource to avoid potential resource leaks. Through this project, users practice fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and basic user interaction in Java. The design of the program promotes user engagement through interactive feedback and encourages logical guessing strategies.
